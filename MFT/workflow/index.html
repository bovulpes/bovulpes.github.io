Proposal for working on the MFT code in O2

The aim is to establish common practices useful to the MFT developers who will 
write code going to the main project AliceO2Group. These guiding lines should 
provide information to each developer about how to:

[1] have at any time the latest code of the AliceO2Group, build it on a local 
copy and use it

[2] manage his own GitHub fork on a local copy, commit his local changes and 
request to pull them to the main project AliceO2Group

[3] have an up-to-date local copy of each GitHub fork of the other developers,
build it and use it

[4] be able to include, for testing purposes, commits done on their forks by 
the other detectors, but which are not yet pulled to the main project 
AliceO2Group

[5] perform the operation from point [4] on a separate (and temporary) branch of 
their local copy of their own fork
