<h1> Proposal for a work-flow on the MFT code in O2 </h1>

<p> <b>Reminder</b>: the O2 main project code is hosted on GitHub as a 
repository of the <b>AliceO2Group</b> here: 
<br>
<pre>https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/</pre>
</p>

<p> and each developer starts by creating a <b>fork</b> of the "dev" branch of the 
main project on his own GitHub account, which will be accessible here:
<br>
<pre>https://github.com/&lt;github-user-name&gt;/AliceO2/</pre>

<p> In the following we will assume three developers working on the MFT code. 
Their repositories will be:</p>

<ul>
<li> https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2/</li><br>
<li> https://github.com/mftdevB/AliceO2/</li><br>
<li> https://github.com/mftdevC/AliceO2/</li><br>
</ul>

<p>Note: of course, each developer may choose in his repository to work on a new 
branch, named, for instance, "mft", instead of using the "dev" branch. This new 
branch will be created on GitHub starting from the existing "dev" branch. 
Therefore, cloning into his local copy will be one of these (for the developer 
A):</p>

<p><pre>git clone -b dev https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2 .</pre></p>
or
<p><pre>git clone -b mft https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2 .</pre></p>

<p> <b>The aim of this document</b> is to establish common practices useful
for the MFT developers who will write code going to the main project
AliceO2Group. These guiding lines should provide information to each
developer about how to: </p>

<ul>

<li> have at any time the latest code of the AliceO2Group, build it on a 
local copy and use it </li>
<br>
<li> manage his own GitHub fork on a local copy, commit his local changes 
and request to pull them to the main project AliceO2Group </li>
<br>
<li> have an up-to-date local copy of each GitHub fork of the other 
developers, build it and use it </li>
<br>
<li> be able to include, for testing purposes, commits done on their forks 
by the other detectors, but which are not yet pulled to the main project 
AliceO2Group </li>
<br>
<li> perform the operation from previous point on a separate (and temporary) 
branch of their local copy of their own fork </li>

</ul>

<p> In the following, we will assume that the local copies of the project will 
be created in the directory <b>/alice/sw/</b>.</p>

<h2> Managing the main project "dev" branch</h2>

<p>After the initial fork of the "dev" branch of the AliceO2Group/AliceO2 
account on your own GitHub account, this branch will have the last commit at 
that very moment and will not evolve anymore, unless you synchronize it.</p>

<p>Two cases can be distinguished here:</p>

<ol>
<li>the developer works on the "dev" branch of this fork</li>
<br>
<li>the developer works, for any reasons, on a new branch, say "mft"</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. This is the case when we want to have the code from the main project 
at any moment, even without our latest commits being pulled by AliceO2Group/dev. 
</h3>

<ul>
<li>clone a local copy<br>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/</pre>
<pre>git clone -b dev https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2 O2-dev</pre>
<li>update as often you find necessary</li>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/O2-dev</pre>
<pre>git pull</pre>
<li><b>never modify code in this directory!</b></pre>
</ul>

<h3> 2. This is the case when we want to keep the "dev" branch on our GitHub 
fork but will not directly work on it (the example user is "mftdevA")</h3>

<ul>
<li>clone a local copy<br>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/</pre>
<pre>git clone -b dev https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2 O2-dev</pre>
<li> add the main project remote source </li>
<pre>cd O2-dev</pre>
<pre>git remote add aliceo2group --track dev https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2</pre>
<li>update, any time you think it is necessary</li>
<pre>git fetch aliceo2group</pre>
<pre>git rebase aliceo2group dev</pre>
<pre>git push</pre>
<li><b>never modify code in this directory!</b></pre>
</ul>

<h2> Managing your repository's "dev" branch when it is your work branch</h2>

<ul>
<li>clone a local copy<br>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/</pre>
<pre>git clone -b dev https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2 O2-my-dev</pre>
<li> add the main project remote source </li>
<pre>cd O2-my-dev</pre>
<pre>git remote add aliceo2group --track dev https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2</pre>
<li>update before doing a push of your modifications to your repository</li>
<pre>git fetch aliceo2group</pre>
<pre>git rebase aliceo2group dev</pre>
<pre>git push -f</pre>
<li>create the pull requests from <b>mftdevA/dev</b> to <b>AliceO2Group/dev</b>
</ul>

<p><b>Important!</b> Notice the "-f" flag: this will allow to modify the commit 
history, since you have worked your latest commits on top of an older "dev" 
branch of the main project.</p>

<h2> Managing your repository's "mft" branch when this is your work 
branch</h2>

<ul>
<li>clone a local copy<br>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/</pre>
<pre>git clone -b mft https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2 O2-mft</pre>
<li> add the main project remote source </li>
<pre>cd O2-mft</pre>
<pre>git remote add aliceo2group --track dev https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2</pre>
<li>update before doing a push of your modifications to your repository</li>
<pre>git fetch aliceo2group</pre>
<pre>git rebase aliceo2group dev</pre>
<pre>git push -f</pre>
<li>create the pull requests from <b>mftdevA/mft</b> to <b>AliceO2Group/dev</b>
</ul>

<h2> Managing work branches from repositories of other developers</h2>

<p>Suppose "mftdevA" and "mftdevB" work on the "dev" branch of their repository, 
while "mftdevC" works on his own "mft" branch and that "mftdevB" would like to 
track the work of the other two developers.</p> 

<ul>
<li>mftdevA = "dev" branch</li><br>
<li>mftdevB = "dev" branch</li><br>
<li>mftdevC = "mft" branch</li><br>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>clone local copies<br>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/</pre>
<pre>git clone -b dev https://github.com/mftdevA/AliceO2 O2-mftdevA</pre>
<pre>git clone -b mft https://github.com/mftdevC/AliceO2 O2-mftdevC</pre>
<li>since there is no mechanism (yet) for re-writing environment variables, 
the building and the execution must be done in different shells</li>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/O2-mftdevA/build_o2</pre>
<pre>cmake ........</pre> 
<pre>make ........</pre>
<pre>source config.sh</pre>
<pre>etc.</pre>
</ul>

<p>Note: there are other ways of working with different branches, without 
changing the local directory, but due to the fact that the user wants to build 
and check each version of the code and that this is done in the common 
"build_o2" directory, I have chosen another, simpler way.</p>

<h3>Including selected commits from another developer for testing purpose</h3>

<p>This is the case when we want to change a small number of files modified by 
another developer in his repository and not yet pulled by the main project.</p>

<p>The first idea is to proceed as above, cloning the code in different 
local directories and then selectively copying files from one directory to 
another.</p>

<ul>
<li>start from the code of our local copy of our repository (I am mftdevB)</li>
<pre>cd /alice/sw/O2-dev</pre>
<li>create a branch to play with, using selected commits from mftdevC</li>
<pre>git branch O2-mftdevC-tmp</pre>
<pre>git checkout O2-mftdevC-tmp</pre>
<li>add the remote repository of the user mftdevC; remember that he is working on the "mft" branch</li>
<pre>git remote add o2mftdevC --track mft https://github.com/mftdevC/AliceO2</pre>
<li>get his code on your local machine and see which branches he is using</li>
<pre>git fetch o2mftdevC</pre>
<pre>git branch -r</pre>
<li> here you will see something like</li>
<pre>  o2mftdevC/mft</pre>
<li>see the log entries of his work on his working branch</li>
<pre>git log o2mftdevC/mft</pre>
<li>and from the list of commits choose the one you want to apply</li>
<pre>git cherry-pick &lt;commit-id&gt;</pre>
<li>if no conflicts exist, you can test your code with his commit on top of it</li>
</ul>
